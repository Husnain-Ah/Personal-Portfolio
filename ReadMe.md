# Personal Portfolio

A lightweight portfolio site to keep my skills from getting rusty and to eventually showcase my side projects.

## Purpose

- **Practice**: A place to experiment with HTML, CSS, and small front-end projects so my skills stay sharp.
- **Showcase**: Eventually this will host polished demos and links to side projects, demos, and source code.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Main landing page with a semantic header and introductory content.
- `styles.css` — Central stylesheet extracted from the HTML for easier maintenance.

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with → Browser).
2. Edit files locally and refresh the browser to see changes.

## Roadmap

- Add a projects section with cards and project links
- Add navigation and responsive improvements
- Publish to GitHub Pages or similar hosting

## Notes

- This repo is intentionally minimal — designed as a sandbox for learning and quick iteration.

*Created to practice and preserve my front-end skills. Contributions are welcome, but this is primarily a personal learning space.*
